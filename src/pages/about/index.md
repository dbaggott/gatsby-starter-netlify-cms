title: 'What is #StandOnEveryCorner?'
---
**#StandOnEveryCorner** is growing national movement of people holding regular, peaceful and family-friendly protests in their neighborhoods.  The protests call for the protection of our democracy and for an end to all the abuses of this administration, especially family separation.  The movement started in June with Bryce Tache in Minneapolis, whose nightly protest has grown into a nationwide movement. Itâ€™s an easy way to get involved on a regular basis, make your voice heard, and connect with neighbors.  Participants in **#StandOnEveryCorner** protests have said they felt empowered, they made connections and plans to take action in other ways, and they had fun!
